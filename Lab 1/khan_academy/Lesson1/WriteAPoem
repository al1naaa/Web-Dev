    <h1>Kiiz ui</h1>
    <p>Oh, Kiiz Ui, sacred home of the nomadâ€™s way,<br>
Sunlight bends through your roof to greet the day.<br>
Your history whispers secrets from times untold,<br>
A cradle of the steppe, where hearts unfold.<br>
<br>
Blessed shelter, revered home, eternal embrace,<br>
Your lattice walls stretch wide, holding their place.<br>
The breeze flows softly through your open door,<br>
Breathing life from the steppe, a spirit to adore.<br>
<br>
Through your roof, I gaze at the boundless sky,<br>
The stars above seem close, as dreams fly high.<br>
Echoes of ancestors, their hopes still endure,<br>
In your sacred circle, their wisdom is pure.<br>
<br>
The gentle wind caresses your sturdy frame,<br>
A timeless haven, proud of its name.<br>
To future generations, you pass the truth,<br>
Oh, Kiiz Ui, the heart of our enduring roots.<br>
